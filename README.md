Used to generate worldedit schematic files, containing big ROMS.
To achieve weird redstone hipster door world records.

All the runnable stuff (abusing Kotest, a Test framework) happens in /romGenerator/scripts.

To run, install the Kotest plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, and run (individual) tests in /romGenerator/scripts.
